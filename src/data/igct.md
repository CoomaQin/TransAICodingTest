## Intelligent Grade Crossing Trespassing

By using a customized Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm for automated trespassing detection based on big-video data, researchers at Rutgers Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation (CAIT) were able to compile large data sets in real-time that provide insights into trespassing behavior.

Retrained DL models for object detection and object tracking that reach 81\% of precision and 93% of recall. Besides, we improved the signal detector, based on short time Fourier transform, whose accuracy and double-counting rate improved 25% and 40%.
