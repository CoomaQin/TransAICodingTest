## Highway Grade Crossing Trespassing Detection

We built a system that utilizes state-of-the-art vision-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to record, recognize, and understand railroad video data in real time. It has been 

In algorithm development, I generalized the signal activation detector, improved object detection accuracy and reduce object tracking duplicated rate. 

In software engineering, I refactored the monolith system to microservices,
